1.	Executive Summary
The Decal Hub is a small family business in northern Michigan that sells customizable decals. After my strategic assessment of their business the strengths of this business I have found to be their strength in high customer satisfaction ratings and innovative product range. For improvement, particularly in IT capabilities and marketing strategies, I have found a few recommendations, that this business could utilize to build its brand to be even stronger in today’s decal industry. I believe it’s important to adopt a proactive approach to IT investments and create an online presence to gain marketing opportunities. 
2.	History and Purpose
2.1	History of the Decal Hub
The Decal Hub was founded by father and son, Corey Hubbard and Glen Hubbard. They operate in St. Helen Michigan and started their business in the year 2014. They create customizable decals and sell these Decals on Amazon, locally in their town, and on Etsy. They currently have 500 decals listed for sale online currently. Their decals range from all sorts of designs such as football, fishing, biking, dirt bikes, baseball, and more. They currently have a high rating of 4.8 stars on Amazon and a 5-star rating on Etsy with over 2,269 sales. The Hubbard family has a passion for creativity and design, and this has been the driving force behind their business's success. 
2.2	Purpose of The Decal Hub
 After speaking with the owner, I found the purpose was originally to be able to create their own working hours and do something they love to do which is create decals. They wanted to get away from the corporate world and spend more time with their family. One of the Owners Corey Hubbard went as far as to gain his associate in graphic art and design. They are not only dedicated to meeting their customer's needs, but they want to contribute positively to their community by providing quality products and supporting local initiatives. Their mission is to bring high-quality custom decals that cater to the unique tastes of their customers. 

3.	Management and Business Processes.
3.1	The Decal Hub fulfills its mission by engaging with its customers in a timely fashion. They gather feedback on Amazon, locally, and on Etsy. They guarantee that if a customer’s decal is damaged due to process and handling, they will send a replacement to them to ensure they have a high-quality decal. The Decal Hub prides itself on its customer service and having high ratings on its Amazon and Etsy pages. 
3.2	They ensure they are keeping up with the latest trends by researching heavily on the market trends and by the customer feedback they receive. This in return helps them with creating a product that meets the market demands. 
3.3	The Decal Hub also buys its vinyl that is used to create decals from high-quality vendors making sure that they can create a high-quality decal, that clients will be satisfied with. 
3.4	The Decal hub strictly puts their product for sale and information on Amazon and Etsy, they have no outside marketing for the decals they create locally other than “word of mouth”
3.5	The decal hub ensures they are Collaborating to create the decals to fit the customer’s needs. The process of creating a decal at The Decal Hub is a collaborative effort involving the entire staff. For example, I will explain the process of actually creating the decal. The steps the decal hub takes is first to customize the decal on their computer according to customer wants. Following this, the decal is precisely cut to the required dimensions. The team then removes any excess vinyl from the design, ensuring only the desired decal remains. Next, an application paper is applied to the decal to facilitate the easy transfer for the client. The prepared decals are then securely placed in tubes, labeled for shipping, and dispatched through the United States Postal Service to various destinations across the United States.

4.3	Staff IT Skills/Training
After accessing the background, I understood the business has very little background in IT.
Corey Hubbard – associate in graphic art and design, Mentioned he has taken a JavaScript coding class. Corey is responsible for creating the decal designs as well as picking the extra vinyl that is not needed and applying the transfer paper to the decal.
Glen Hubbard- Bachelor’s degree in business majoring in Accounting and minoring in Finance. He is responsible for customizing the decals and printing the decals out as well as ensuring they stay within their budget. 
Keyla Martinito- Has no background in IT and has been a staff member since 2014. Her role is to help with picking the extra vinyl for the decal and helping apply the application paper to the decal.
Theresa Hubbard- Has no background in IT. Is responsible for packaging the product and applying the shipping labels, as well as sending them out via USPS. 
4.4	IT Budgeting and Spending

After speaking with the Decal Hub their IT spending is very minimal because the cost of their materials is higher. Their IT spending currently is:
•	Amazon- $40 monthly plus a 20% fee per product sold
•	Etsy- 20 cents a listing plus a 20% fee per product sold
•	Vinyl cut master- 0 basic plan
•	Adobe- $22.99 a month
Their monthly material costs range from $2,000 to 4,000 depending on the customer's demands. 
5.	Envisioned IT Capabilities
5.1	Leadership’s Vision
The Decal Hub's vision is to continue to create and meet the unique tastes of their customers that fit their varied hobbies and interests. They plan to continue to foster continuous improvement, where their team is determined to come up with new ideas to meet those goals. They want to have better support for local customers and provide sustainability for their business and products. As the Decal Hub grows, The Decal Hub wants to remain a family-orientated business at heart, valuing the personal connections they make along the way.

5.2	Top 10 Technology Issues
1.	One issue The Decal Hub faces is that with the program they currently use “Vinyl cut master” It freezes when they have too many customizable pages open, and it has to restart. This makes things slow down and can restart without saving the customizes, which in turn makes The decal hub have to re-create those customizes. 
2.	The decal hub has a lack of online marketing strategy. 
3.	Depending on a single program for the production of the decals.
4.	Limited customer engagement locally.
5.	Limited IT equipment
6.	Lack of a business website they could use for online engagement
7.	Poor data backup, which risks the loss of all their designs
8.	Basic software, instead of the upgraded versions
9.	NO IT support
10.	Outdated Hardware


6.	Closing the Gap
6.1	Recommendation 1- My first recommendation would be for the Decal Hub to invest in a newer PC. Outdated software leads to slower operations and limits the ability to upgrade IT capabilities. My recommendation would be to invest in the Dell XPS 8940 or the Acer Aspire Z27 which are highly recommended choices for graphic designers while also remaining affordable. They would still have the old PC, but they could back this up on a USB to ensure they have all their data saved. 
6.2	Recommendation 2-Another recommendation would be to invest in having two, 27-inch monitors. The decal hub currently only has one 12-inch monitor. If there were two this would allow the decal hub to run multiple applications at once without having to change the windows. This could result in faster production. I recommend 27-inch monitors because 12-inch monitors could result in an effect on eye health. After all, the monitor is so small, it creates eye strain. This could potentially be a huge risk if a member starts to have vision issues. A 27-inch monitor placed about 28 inches away would be more comfortable and ideal for a long workday. 
6.3	Recommendation 3- I would also recommend that the Decal Hub create its website online where it can market its products, this would allow the decal to have a platform they could send locals from their hometown to access for product purchases. It could also bring in more income as it would be their website where they do not have to pay a 20% fee to Amazon or Etsy per decal sold. 
6.4	Recommendation 4- Another recommendation would be to market themselves online through social media by creating an Instagram account or Facebook, they can receive reviews there and be more engaged with customers.
6.5	Recommendation 5- Another recommendation would be to upgrade from their basic Vinyl Cut free software to the Vinyl Master Cut V5 which costs $59.99. This upgraded plan allows for more tools to improve productivity. It includes advanced cutting tools that will produce amazing decals with more than 5,200 fonts. It auto-generates an outline for print and cut. It allows for multiple copies to do a step and repeat. Many different shapes, shadows, and effects can be utilized. 

7.	Conclusions
In conclusion, My recommendations given would be an investment in cost for the Decal Hub, but I believe that this would allow the Decal Hub the opportunity to take their small business to the next level!
